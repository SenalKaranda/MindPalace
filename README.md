**Your Family's Digital Memory Palace**

> *"I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose."*  
> — Sherlock Holmes, *A Study in Scarlet*

MindPalace is a touchscreen-first family organization hub that transforms your home display into a centralized command center. Inspired by the ancient Greek **Method of Loci** (memory palace technique) used by Sherlock Holmes, MindPalace helps you visually organize and access everything important to your household—all in one beautiful, intuitive interface.

## 🎯 What is MindPalace?

MindPalace is a self-hosted web application designed specifically for touch-enabled displays (tablets, smart displays, Raspberry Pi setups, etc.). It's your family's digital "memory palace"—a single place where you can:

- 📅 **Track schedules** with multi-calendar support
- ✅ **Manage tasks** and chores with reward systems
- 🍽️ **Plan meals** and generate shopping lists
- 📝 **Take notes** and set reminders
- ⏰ **Set alarms** for the whole household
- 📸 **Display family photos** from your Immich server
- 🌤️ **Monitor weather** with detailed forecasts
- 🎁 **Track rewards** and motivate family members
- 📋 **Organize groceries** and meal suggestions
- 🏠 **Display house rules** for everyone to see

Everything is organized visually, making it easy to see what's happening in your household at a glance.

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Everyone)

### What You'll Need

- A computer or server to run MindPalace (Raspberry Pi, old laptop, Proxmox VM, etc.)
- Node.js installed (version 16 or higher)
- An internet connection
- (Optional) A CalDAV calendar server for scheduling
- (Optional) An Immich instance for photo display
- (Optional) An OpenWeatherMap API key for weather

### Installation Steps

1. **Download MindPalace**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MindPalace.git
   cd MindPalace
   ```

2. **Install the Backend**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment**
   
   Create `server/.env`:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   HOST=localhost
   ADMIN_PIN=1234
   ```
   
   Create `client/.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
   VITE_HOST=localhost
   ```
   
   **Note:** By default, both server and client listen on `localhost` (only accessible from the same machine). To allow access from other devices on your local network, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in `server/.env` and `VITE_HOST=0.0.0.0` in `client/.env`.

5. **Start the Application**
   
   In one terminal:
   ```bash

   npm start
   ```
   
   In another terminal:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open in Your Browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in the terminal)

**Supported CalDAV Servers:**
- Nextcloud
- Radicale
- Baikal
- SabreDAV/Davis

### Environment Variables

#### Backend (`server/.env`)
```env
PORT=5000                    # Backend server port
HOST=localhost              # Network interface to bind to (localhost = 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0 = all interfaces/LAN access)
ADMIN_PIN=1234              # PIN for admin actions (change this!)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-key     # For encrypting calendar passwords (32+ bytes)
```

#### Frontend (`client/.env`)
```env
VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
VITE_HOST=localhost         # Network interface for dev server (localhost = 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0 = all interfaces/LAN access)
```

**Network Access Configuration:**
- **Default (`localhost`)**: Only accessible from the same machine (more secure)
- **LAN Access (`0.0.0.0`)**: Accessible from other devices on your local network
  - Set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in `server/.env` to allow LAN access to the backend
  - Set `VITE_HOST=0.0.0.0` in `client/.env` to allow LAN access to the frontend dev server
  - **Note:** When using `0.0.0.0`, you can access the app from other devices using your machine's local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:5000` for backend, `http://192.168.1.100:3001` for frontend)

### Port Configuration

**Default Ports:**
- Backend: `5000`
- Frontend: `3000` (Vite will auto-increment if in use)

**Custom Ports:**

Backend - Set in `server/.env`:
```env
PORT=8080
```

Frontend - Set in `client/vite.config.js`:
```javascript
export default {
  server: {
    port: 3001
  }
}
```

Don't forget to update `client/.env` if you change the backend port!

### Security

#### Admin PIN Protection

Sensitive actions require an admin PIN:
- Adding/editing/deleting meals
- Managing house rules
- Removing/overriding marbles
- Clearing checked grocery items
- Generating grocery lists
- Converting meal suggestions
- Managing calendar sources
- Updating API settings

The PIN is stored in browser localStorage after verification (session-based).

**Change the default PIN** in `server/.env`:
```env
ADMIN_PIN=your_secure_pin_here
```

#### Data Encryption

Calendar passwords are encrypted using AES-256-CBC before storage. Set a strong `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in production.

### Backup & Restore

#### Backup Your Data

```bash
# Backup database (contains all app data)
cp server/data/tasks.db /path/to/backup/

# Backup uploaded photos
cp -r server/uploads /path/to/backup/

# Backup custom widgets
cp -r server/widgets /path/to/backup/

# Backup photo cache (optional)
cp -r server/cache /path/to/backup/
```

#### Restore from Backup

```bash
# Restore database
cp /path/to/backup/tasks.db server/data/

# Restore uploads
cp -r /path/to/backup/uploads server/

# Restore widgets
cp -r /path/to/backup/widgets server/
```

### Reverse Proxy Setup (Optional)

For HTTPS and custom domains using Nginx:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Widgets Not Loading
- Check Admin Panel → Widgets tab to ensure widgets are enabled
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API connectivity (check backend server logs)
- Ensure widgets handle both light/dark themes properly

#### Calendar Not Showing Events
- Verify calendars are enabled in Admin Panel → Calendars
- Use "Test Connection" button to verify CalDAV server accessibility
- Check backend logs for CalDAV connection errors
- Ensure your CalDAV server supports REPORT requests
- Verify credentials are correct

#### Weather Widget Not Working
- Confirm OpenWeatherMap API key is valid in Admin Panel → APIs
- Check API key hasn't exceeded rate limits (free tier: 60 calls/minute)
- Verify zip code format in Admin Panel → Interface → Weather
- Check browser console for API error messages

#### Server Not Starting
```bash
# Check if port is already in use
# Linux/Mac:
lsof -i :5000  # Backend
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend

# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Check server logs in terminal
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Ensure write permissions for data directory
chmod -R 755 server/data

# If using uploads directory
chmod -R 755 server/uploads
```
